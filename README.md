# Python-To-AI-Journey

The following repo serves as a way to document my learning journey as I learn about machine learning and artificial intelligence. Each course I take will have its own groupings of small projects completed over the entire course, as well as a final project of my own that I will use to consolidate all of the new knowledge learned. ðŸ˜Š


## Overview of Learning Journey:

- [ ] Learning Python Basics (Functions, Variables, Databases, Data Structures, etc.)
- [ ] End of first section project (Graphical adventure game)
- [ ] Intermediate Python, NumPy, Pandas, and Data Science Foundations
- [ ] Data analysis and Visualization Project
- [ ] Introduction to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
- [ ] Stock price prediction project
- [ ] Deep Learning Fundamentals
- [ ] Deep Learning Model Project (TensorFlow or PyTorch)
- [ ] Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals 
- [ ] Implement a reinforcement learning agent
